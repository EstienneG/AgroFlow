Do not fertilize the seedlings until their cotyledons (seed leaves - the first two leaf-like structures that emerge) are fully expanded and their true leaves are beginning to unfold. Fertilization should be in liquid form and at one-half the rate for any of the ratios listed in the following section on \"Liquid Feeding.\" Seedlings can be held for a limited time if fertilization is withheld until 3 to 4 days before \"pricking out.\" Seed that is sown into pots and cells that will not be \"pricked out\" can be germinated in a mix that contains fertilizer.\n",

      "To get earlier, more uniform emergence, germinate and grow seedlings on benches or in a floor-heated greenhouse. Germination can be aided by using germination mats and chambers which provide heat directly to the trays. In the case of chambers, relative humidity can be controlled. These mats and chambers allow you to set the optimal temperature for germination. With supplemental heating, seedling emergence and uniformity can be enhanced, which decreases the amount of time required to produce a transplant. If heated floors or benches are not available, seed the trays, water, and stack them off the floor during germination. Additionally wrapping the trays in plastic to maintain a high relative humidity can be helpful for some crops like seedless watermelons but only wrap and stack them for up to 24 to 36 hr . Check for emergence and germination often. Unwrap and unstack as soon as germination is observed.\n",
      "Heating and Venting. Exhaust from heaters must be vented to the outside. Be sure to have an outside fresh-air intake for the heaters. Be sure vents and fans are properly designed and positioned to avoid drawing exhaust gases into the greenhouse. Exhaust gases improperly adjusted heating systems can cause yellowing, stunting, distortion, and death of seedlings. Do not grow or hold seedlings in an area where pesticides are stored.\n",

      "Hardening and Transplant Height Control. Proper hardening of transplants stiffens stems and hardens the transplants, which decreases the chances of transplant shock and increases the chances for survival.

More details are in the section below Chemical Hardening.\n",

A two-stem system may also be used, in which the plants should be spaced 18-30 in. apart within the row. If using a standard staking system, plants should be spaced 18-24 in. apart. Once the plants are established, suckers must be removed several times a week. If the main growing point is broken off, a sucker can be trained to take its place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because most heirloom tomatoes have little disease resistance, it is important to maintain a good fungicide spray schedule. For organic production, it might be necessary to grow heirloom tomatoes under high tunnels, especially in areas with high disease pressure. Grafting heirloom varieties onto diseases resistant rootstocks might also increase your success at growing organically. Disease resistant heirloom-type hybrids are often successful in organic systems when paired with a timely spray program.\n",

      "Colorado Potato Beetle (CPB), Flea Beetles (FB): While flea beetles are a common pest of tomato throughout the southeastern US, Colorado potato beetles are most common in areas where significant acreage of potatoes is also grown. Flea beetles are primarily a problem early in the season shortly after planting and are usually controlled by insecticides applied to control other insects. Adults feed on foliage, resulting in small round holes on leaves. In most situations this damage does not affect early season growth or subsequent yields, but control may be necessary when populations are high ( $20-30 \\%$ defoliation).\n",
      "\n",
      "Colorado potato beetle adults and larvae feed on tomato foliage and can cause extensive defoliation if not controlled. CPB feed only on solanaceous plants, and populations tend to be concentrated in areas where potato, eggplant, and tomato have previously been grown. Consequently, rotation to non-solanaceous crops is very effective in helping to avoid infestations. Thoroughly scout fields and spray only when necessary. Treatment should be made if populations exceed 15 adults per 10 plants or a combination of 20 CPB larvae and/or adults per 10 plants. Insecticide sprays should be made after most egg masses have hatched, but before larvae become large. CPB have developed resistance to many different insecticides, so knowledge of the resistance status of populations in your area is essential in choosing which insecticides to use.\n",

      "Tomato Fruitworm: The tomato fruitworm, also known as the corn earworm and cotton bollworm, is potentially the most damaging pest of tomato. However, there are many insecticides that provide excellent control. The key to controlling this insect is to ensure that there is a toxic pesticide residue on the plant during egg laying periods so that larvae are killed shortly after hatching, because larvae feed on leaf tissue for only \n",

Plastic should be placed immediately over the fumigated soil. The soil must be moist when laying the plastic. Fumigation alone may not provide satisfactory weed control under clear plastic. Herbicides labeled and recommended for use on cucumbers may not provide satisfactory weed control when used under clear plastic mulch on nonfumigated soil. Black plastic can be used without a herbicide. Fertilizer must be applied during bed preparation.

This is because these varieties have been bred specifically for greenhouse conditions - lower light, higher humidity and temperature, etc., and they have better disease resistance than field types.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearly all greenhouse cucumber varieties are gynecious, parthenocarpic hybrids. This means that these varieties produce only female flowers and the fruit are seedless. Since they are all female, no pollination is needed. The seedless characteristic makes the fruit very tender to eat. Greenhouse cucumbers are also thin skinned which makes them more desirable than field varieties. While non-greenhouse types would grow in the greenhouse, the yield and quality would be reduced, and therefore they may not be profitable.\n",

      "Variety selection is based on yield, fruit size, uniformity, disease resistance, and lack of physiological disorders, as well as the market demand for the type grown. In some markets the long, European types sells better, while in others, the small beit alpha types, also referred to as \"minis\", are preferred.
